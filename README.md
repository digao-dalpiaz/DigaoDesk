Desktop App to Run and Monitor Console Processes

![Preview](images/preview.png)

# Purpose

When we are working with local services, especially with Microservices, we often need to run and monitor several applications together.

If we are developing applications, we will have some services running directly in the IDE. However, we don't want to run all services directly in the IDE, usually when talking about dependencies.

For these cases, I developed this tool, where you can add all local applications, allowing them to run simultaneously and monitor the output of each one.

You will be able to configure backend and frontend applications.

# Press play and go get a coffee

The idea of ​​this software is to allow applications to run in the background, without disturbing the focus on the main work, for example, using the development IDE.

Thus, the application is running in the Windows tray, allowing monitoring at any time, and displaying activity alerts.
